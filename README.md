# Thingscorp

A simple static website with a Figblocks-inspired design. Use this repository to build and share small projects.

## Development

To view the site locally without installing external packages, run:

```bash
npm run serve
```

This uses `server.js` to start a small HTTP server on port 8080. Open <http://localhost:8080> in your browser.
